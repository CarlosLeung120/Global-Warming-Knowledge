   <h1>Effects of Global Warming</h1>
   <p>After talking about global warming itself
   and the causes of global warming, I am now going
   to talk about what happens after global warming has
   happened, the effects of global warming<br><br>
   So the first effect of global warming is the rise of
   sea level in the oceans, and the reason for that is
   because of the icebergs all around the world melting
   into water, causing the sea level to rise since there
   is more water, another affect after that is that some
   places around the world that are lowlands, and because
   sea level is rising, these lowlands will have a lot
   more problems of flooding after global warming has
   happened, also in the worst case, the lowlands can get
   lower than the sea level, causing the lowland to be
   gone forever.<br>
