   <h1>What can YOU do</h1>
   <p>After talking on and on and on about global warming
   and what it will do to planet earth, we will now finally
   talk about how WE shall avoid global warming from happening!
   </p><br><br>
   <h3>Use renewable energy</h3><br>
   <p>Yes you may have heard of this for lots of times but this
   does really help. Compared to burning fossil fuels, using
   renewable energy is still a very good way to prevent global
   warming from happening. When you want to get the energy you
   want from burning fossil fuels, it releases a lot of carbon
   dioxide into the air, which causes global warming, and in fact,
   the amount of carbon doixide in the atmosphere has increase by
   "number"parts per million after the industrial revolution, and
   most of carbon dioxide is created from burning fossil fuels. So
   that is why we should stop using fossil fuel and start using
   renewable energy since it does not give out anything when you
   use it, and the energy comes from energy that can be reused
   like for example: hydroelectricity, sunlight and wind power.

   <h3>Use less electricity and water</h3><br>
   <p>In fact there are already a lot of ways to use less
   electricity and water, e.g. use LED light bulbs,
   innovative shower systems are some examples, since these
   products are all reducing our consumption of energy and water
   and also can reduce the costs of our bills, it is a very good
   choice to use these products.
   </p><br><br>
   <h3>Use more public transport</h3>
   <p>You might have heard of these things before but it is very
   important to do this more oftenly, taking public transport is
   a good way to help global warming, as there is less cars on
   the road, there will be more people taking buses and trains with
   more people grouped together, which is going to reduce a bit of traffic
   flow and reduce the carbon dioxide polluted.
