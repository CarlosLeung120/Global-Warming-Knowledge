   <h2>Introduction and the causes of global warming</h2>
   <p>Global warming is a problem in fact so big to the
   whole wide world it can lead to some immense problems
   to us humans, and yes in this website you will get to
   know more about global warming itself, the effects it
   can give us and what different people can do about it
   and starting off we are going to talk about some
   general things about global warming , now global warming
   is a is a phenomenon of climate change characterized by
   a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth,
   which modifies, changes and more less worsens the weather's
   balances and ecosystems for a very long period of time.
   And the difference between climate change and global warming
   Is that global warming is something that only relates to
   the temperature of the earth's surface rising, but climate
   change is something that happens after global warming, climate
   change is also one effect after global warming has already
   happened. Global warming is also global warming is directly
   linked to the increase of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere,
   worsening the greenhouse effect, in which the greenhouse affect
   is The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from
   a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to a temperature
   above what it would be without this atmosphere.<br><br>
   And after showing some general information about global warming, I
   will now indeed start to talk about some of the causes for global
   warming to happen in the first place.<br>
   Starting off, one of the causes of global warming to happen is
   because of gases in the atmosphere blocking the heat from escaping,
   and there are several types of gases that are in the atmosphere and
   blocking the heat from escaping, and these types of gases are:</p><br>
    <ol>
     <li>Water Vapour(H2O)</li>
     <li>Carbon Dioxide(CO2)</li>
     <li>Methane(CH4)</li>
     <li>Nitrous Oxide(N2O)</li>
   </ol>
   <p>And these types of gases can also be split into two groups, the first
   groups, and the first group is the forcing gases,which this
   group of long lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the
   atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes
   in temperature. And the other group is the feedback gases, they are
   gases that respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature.
   And this is the result after splitting them into their respected
   catagories.<br>
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Forcing Gases</th>
       <th>Feedback Gases</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Carbon Dioxide(Co2)</td>
       <td>Water Vapour(H2O)</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Nitrous Oxide(N20)</td>
       <td>Methane(CH4)</td>
     </tr>
